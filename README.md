# TIC TAC TOE game in Tkinter (Python)

## Requirement
* Python 3.9 or newer

## Note

This is a really basic tkinter-based GUI version of the game "tic-tac-toe".  
The game works in a way that after each player's turn, lists of lines in different direction 
will be checked to see whether a winner is set.  
Feel free to use any part of this program.
